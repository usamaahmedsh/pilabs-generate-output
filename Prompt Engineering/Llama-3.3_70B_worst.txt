Brush Language Specification
=========================
Version 1.2
Release Date: 2023-02-15

Introduction
------------

Brush is a modern, statically-typed programming language designed for building scalable and maintainable software systems. It is designed to be efficient, flexible, and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity and readability.

Language Features
----------------

* Statically-typed with type inference
* Object-oriented programming with classes, interfaces, and inheritance
* Functional programming with higher-order functions and closures
* Built-in support for concurrency and parallelism
* Extensive standard library with support for file I/O, networking, and more

Syntax
------

The Brush language syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, with a focus on simplicity and consistency. The language uses a syntax similar to other modern programming languages, with a few key differences.

* Indentation is used to denote block-level structure, rather than curly braces or keywords
* Semicolons are optional, and are only required in certain contexts
* The language uses a consistent naming convention, with camelCase used for variable and function names

Type System
------------

The Brush type system is based on a combination of static typing and type inference. The language uses a type system similar to other modern programming languages, with a few key differences.

* The language uses a concept called "type classes" to define a set of types that can be used in a particular context
* The language also uses a concept called "type inference" to automatically determine the types of variables and expressions

Standard Library
----------------

The Brush standard library provides a wide range of functions and classes for performing common tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and data structures. The library is designed to be easy to use and extensible, with a focus on simplicity and consistency.

* The library provides a set of built-in functions for working with files and directories, including `readFile`, `writeFile`, and `mkdir`
* The library also provides a set of built-in functions for working with networks, including `tcpConnect`, `udpSend`, and `httpGet`

Technical Details
-----------------

* The Brush compiler is written in C++ and uses a combination of recursive descent parsing and abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation to generate machine code
* The language uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to generate machine code at runtime, which provides a significant performance boost compared to interpreted languages
* The language also uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory and prevent memory leaks

Changelog
=========

Version 1.2
Release Date: 2023-02-15

* Fixed bug #123: incorrect handling of null pointer exceptions in the standard library
* Added support for async/await syntax, allowing for easier writing of concurrent code
* Improved performance of the JIT compiler by 15%
* Added new `brush.lang` package for working with language-specific features, including syntax highlighting and code completion
* Fixed bug #456: incorrect handling of type inference in certain contexts
* Added new `brush.net` package for working with network sockets and protocols
