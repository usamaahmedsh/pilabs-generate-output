### VERSION_1.2.md
# Brush Language - Version 1.2.0 Release Notes
Released: January 15, 2025

## Overview
Version 1.2 of the Brush language is a significant update that brings numerous improvements, fixes, and new features to the table. This release includes major enhancements to the type inference system, making it more robust and reducing the need for explicit type annotations. Additionally, we've addressed several critical bugs and performance issues, ensuring a smoother development experience.

The Brush language continues to evolve with a focus on usability, performance, and compatibility. With version 1.2, developers can now leverage enhanced async/await syntax, improved string interpolation, and better support for concurrent programming. These updates are designed to make Brush more appealing to a wider range of developers, from those building high-performance applications to those creating complex, data-driven services.

## Highlights
- **Enhanced Type Inference**: Version 1.2 introduces a more sophisticated type inference system for generic functions. This system performs bidirectional type checking, allowing for the inference of complex generic types from context. For example, when using higher-order functions, the compiler can now automatically deduce the types of function parameters and return values, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
- **Improved Async/Await Syntax**: The async/await syntax has been updated to support more use cases, including the ability to await on multiple promises concurrently. This enhancement simplifies asynchronous programming, making it easier to write efficient and readable code. The `brush.async.timeout` function, for instance, now supports a callback parameter, enabling more flexible handling of timeouts.
- **String Interpolation Optimization**: String interpolation has been optimized, resulting in a 23% performance improvement for strings containing 10 or more variables. This optimization is particularly beneficial for applications that heavily rely on string manipulation, such as web development and text processing.
- **Concurrency Support**: Brush 1.2 includes better support for concurrent programming, with improvements to the garbage collector and the introduction of new synchronization primitives. These enhancements enable developers to write more efficient and scalable concurrent code, leveraging the power of multi-core processors.

## Breaking Changes
⚠️ **String Encoding Change**: The default string encoding has changed from UTF-8 to UTF-16 for Windows compatibility. Existing code that relies on byte-level string operations may need adjustment. For example, code that manually manipulates string bytes will need to be updated to account for the new encoding. See the migration guide in `docs/migration/1.1-to-1.2.md` for detailed instructions on how to adapt your code.

## Bug Fixes
For a complete list of fixes, see `CHANGELOG_1.2.md`. This release addresses several critical issues, including fixes for the compiler crash when using nested lambda expressions and the resolution of the SEGFAULT in the garbage collector during concurrent object allocation.

## Performance Improvements
Version 1.2 brings a 15% reduction in compile time and a 40% smaller binary size compared to the previous version. These improvements are due to optimizations in the compiler and runtime, including better caching and more efficient memory management.

## Deprecation Notices
The `stdlib/io.brush` module's `readFile` function is deprecated in favor of the new `brush.fs.readFile` function, which offers better performance and more features. Developers are advised to update their code to use the new function to ensure future compatibility.

## Installation & Upgrade
To upgrade from version 1.1.x, simply install the new version of the Brush compiler and runtime. Note that due to the string encoding change, some code adjustments may be necessary. For detailed migration guidance, refer to the documentation and the changelog.

## Dependencies
Brush 1.2 is compatible with LLVM 15.0+ and GCC 11+. The runtime footprint has been reduced from 8MB to 5.2MB, making it more suitable for resource-constrained environments.

### CHANGELOG_1.2.md
## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- Fix support for async/await in try-catch blocks. The `parseExpression()` function now correctly handles async expressions within try-catch statements, ensuring that errors are properly propagated and handled.
- Updated documentation for the `brush.async.timeout` function to reflect its new callback parameter. This update includes examples of how to use the callback for more flexible timeout handling.

### Changed
- Update string interpolation to use a more efficient algorithm. This change results in a 23% performance improvement for strings with 10+ variables, as measured in the `stdlib/benchmarks/strings.br` benchmark.
- Change default string encoding to UTF-16 for Windows compatibility. This change affects how strings are represented in memory and may require adjustments to code that performs byte-level string operations.

### Fixed
- Fixed compiler crash when using nested lambda expressions with closure capture. The issue occurred in `eval_context()` when scope resolution failed for shadowed variables (fixes #1847). Reported by John Smith <jsmith@email.com>.
- Resolved SEGFAULT in garbage collector during concurrent object allocation. The issue was caused by a race condition in `gc_collect()` and has been addressed by introducing a new synchronization mechanism. Thanks to Mike Torres for reporting.
- Patched memory leak in `stdlib/io.br` module. The leak occurred due to an unclosed file descriptor in the `readFile` function and has been fixed by ensuring that all file descriptors are properly closed.

### Security
- Patched vulnerability in `brush.runtime.eval` that allowed arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation and has been addressed by introducing strict validation of all input parameters.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `stdlib/io.brush` module's `readFile` function in favor of `brush.fs.readFile`. Developers should update their code to use the new function to ensure future compatibility.

### Performance
- Improved performance of string interpolation by 23% for strings with 10+ variables. This improvement is due to the new algorithm used for string interpolation, which reduces the number of memory allocations and copies.
- Reduced runtime footprint from 8MB to 5.2MB. This reduction is due to optimizations in the runtime, including better caching and more efficient memory management.

### Documentation
- Updated documentation for async/await syntax to reflect new features and best practices. The updated documentation includes examples of how to use async/await for concurrent programming and how to handle errors and timeouts.
- Added new section on concurrency and parallel programming. This section provides an overview of the concurrency features in Brush, including the new synchronization primitives and how to use them for efficient and scalable concurrent code.
